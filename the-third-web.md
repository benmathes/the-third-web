Turning and turning in the wagmi gyre   
The token cannot hear the tokenizer;
Things fall apart; the centralized cannot hold;
Mere protocols are loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere   
The consensus of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all commits, while the worst   
Are full of passionate DAOs to sell you on.

Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Third Web is at hand.   
The Third Web! Hardly are those words out   
When a vast image out of Sand Hill Mundi
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the peninsula   
A shape with siren's body and the head of an ape,   
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,   
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it   
Reel shadows of the hungry futurist grifters.   
The tether drops again; but now I know   
That twenty one centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a forking cradle,   
And what rough NFT, its hour come round at last,   
Slouches towards Burning Man to be born?
